        <p>I joined University of Utah Coding Bootcamp to start a new career in Web Programing.  My first experience with HTML was back in the mid 90's.  
            We made websites and published them in good ol GeoCities.  My professional career is in the hardware side of the computer industry.  I have certifications in A+ and network+.      
        </p>  
        <p>At the moment, I am a stay-at-home dad of six children.  Their age ranges from three to seventeen.  My wife is a regirstered nurse
            for Riverton Hospital.  On my spare time I go online to learn coding by watching youtube videos and doing web tutorials in W3schools.</p>
            <p>I enjoy watching football, basketball, and boxing.  I also like fishing and going on vacations with my family.
